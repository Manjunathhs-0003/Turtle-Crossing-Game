    <h1>Turtle Crossing Game</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project involves creating a game using Python's Turtle module. It simulates a scenario where a player navigates through traffic using arrow keys while avoiding collision with cars. As the player progresses, the game becomes more challenging with increasing car speeds.</p>
    
   <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Player control using arrow keys</li>
        <li>Dynamic car generation and movement</li>
        <li>Scoreboard to track player's progress</li>
        <li>Level progression with increasing difficulty</li>
    </ul>

        <code>cd project-name</code>
        <li>Run game file:</li>
        <code>python main.py</code>
    </ol>
